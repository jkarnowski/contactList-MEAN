learn the MEAN stack through a basic CRUD app

## Get started
- I use npm package manager
- make sure you have node, mongodb, and express installed
- for example, to install and save express to this project:
```
$ npm i -S express
```

## to run
- run the node server (HINT: check the json package to see why I don't have to run $ node server.js )
```
$ npm run dev
```
